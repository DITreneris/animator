# Lessons from the robot office episodes

What worked and what failed while making *Says Here You Were Our Boss*, *He Always Said Thank You*, *Make It Better* and *Just For Now* (3–6 Nov 2026). The same lessons were proposed for the `viral-loop-animation` skill.

## Comedy

- **Characters beat situations.** The guy hiding his own smiley got better reviews than the building collapsing.
- **An expected disaster isn't a punchline.** If the setup says it will fall, make the fall a false ending and put the surprise after it (Just For Now: collapse → "Should I put it back?" → POP).
- **Escalation means worse, not more.** Each scene must add a joke or make the character sillier; extra events alone don't.
- **One visible physical rule.** Viewers must see what holds what up. A sticky note can't cause a collapse; load-bearing tape can.
- **End on a word that finishes the arc,** set up out loud earlier ("I'll fix it Friday" → "FRIDAY.").
- **A bigger twist can repeat the joke at a larger scale** (the boss robot with the same secret).
- **Plain words for general viewers:** everyday feedback and excuses, not "scope" or "context windows".

## Openings and loops

- The first seconds must make sense with no context. *Make It Better* v1 opened on the payoff and confused people; v2 states the situation first.
- Use several quick shots (crash zoom, smash cut, sprint-in), not one static wide shot or a slow zoom on a bubble.
- Don't split a sentence across the loop point or repeat the same words at the join. Loop through a character's action (the Tester reaching for the tape again) or a reaction (the army's roar).
- Call a hard cut a hard cut.

## Process

- Generate and measure voices before fixing scene lengths.
- Build a rough version before polishing. A 2-scene test checks one joke but can't judge a story.
- For a line choice, render identical versions and show them to different people; ask what made them laugh.
- Treat reviewers' scores as opinions until real viewers test it. Separate agreements from disagreements and say plainly where the reviewer was right.
- Frames and loudness can be checked from code; comedy timing, voices and mix need a person.

## Technical

- Ease functions that return 0 at the start make cairo's scale invalid; clamp to 0.02.
- Draw props that carry the joke after the characters; check bubbles don't cover labels or heads.
- A navy hoodie disappears on dark backgrounds; lighten the background.
- Long digital silence sounds like a fault; add faint room tone.
- Set the limiter below the target peak (AAC overshoots), then re-measure the final file.

# Lessons from Payday Slam → The List

What worked and what failed while turning the "Wait, you guys are getting paid?" meme into *The List* (3–6 Nov 2026).

- **Copying the meme's table isn't a video.** *Payday Slam* was clear but had 16 numbers and no funny action; the reviewer's verdict was "too many numbers, no funny animation".
- **More shots lost the story.** Separate close-ups per character made each gag funnier, but without a shared setting or labels, viewers couldn't follow who was who or why the coder paid.
- **Go back to what worked and add only the best gags.** The fix was the original meme's one-screen comparison plus one gag and one number per row.
- **Test the joke with one still before animating.** A single image of the finished list confirmed the story was clear in seconds, before any animation time was spent.
- **Approve in stages:** style still → punchline clip with voice → storyboard → still → animated draft. The punchline clip is the stage that decides the rest.
- **Keep the caption identical to the voice line.** A reviewer suggested a shorter caption, but it would no longer match the recorded line.
- **Repetition can be funnier than clarity:** −$200 shown four times beat "−$200/month".
- **Fill an empty opening with the character.** Starting the coder huge and shrinking him as each row arrives fixed both the weak first frame and the empty middle of the screen (the author's idea).
- **Recorded voices beat synthesized ones for the punchline,** and their real lengths set the timing.

# Lessons from Payday Slot Machine

What came out of making and reviewing *Payday Slot Machine* (3–4 Nov 2026, added 7 Nov).

- **Ask for concepts, get concepts.** Five ranked ideas with hook, joke and payoff made choosing quick; the slot machine won because the meme was already a four-beat reveal.
- **Protect the reveal.** A slowing reel showed "$600k" 0.2 s before the jackpot. Check the frames just before each payoff, not only the payoff itself.
- **Measure the file you deliver.** Loudness was first reported from before a final level change; the delivered file was quieter. Repeat checks after every rebuild.
- **Leave headroom before AAC.** A −1 dBFS peak rose to about 0 dBFS after encoding; limit first, then normalize.
- **Pin the encoder for reproducible builds.** With automatic x264 threads, two builds differed in three frames; a fixed `-threads` value made rebuilds byte-identical.
- **Font files differ between copies.** The repo's Anton is a different build from the one first used; fitting text to the frame width keeps any build on screen.

# Lessons from UptimeZ Inc.

What came out of *Saved Locally*, *Where Files Live* and *Prompt Telephone* (6–7 Nov 2026), after four tester reviews.

## Comedy

- **Recognition isn't laughter.** "So true" reactions meant the idea was relatable but not funny. The fix was people being ridiculous about AI, not AI being clever.
- **Don't invent a stand-in.** Testers didn't know what "SAVI" was; real, familiar things (Downloads, the cloud, a LinkedIn-style post) need no explaining.
- **Take jargon literally.** "Make it bold" → a post about a bald head works because every viewer knows both words.
- **Show the cause before the effect.** Each person's mistake must be visible as it happens, and each must be worse than the last.
- **Turn the punchline on the smug one.** DON's "Finally. A post about me." beat any ending where the AI or the junior loses.
- **The brand is the straight man.** A polished, earnest company page makes the chaos inside it funnier; it never jokes itself.

## Testing

- Don't test a visual gag with audio only, and don't loop a clip three times before asking for the first reaction.
- Five viewers against five can't prove a winner; use tests to find what confuses people.
- Measure confusion (where people got lost), not the number of gags.

## Technical

- Wrap earlier modules at runtime (`pt43` patches the kit's face drawing for lip-sync) instead of editing them, then check old cuts still match by checksum.
- Drive lip-sync and word cues from the measured voice timings (`pt43_sync.json`), not from hand-typed times.
- Chain a speaker's TTS clips with a small gap; overlapping clips from one voice sound broken.
- `loudnorm` left these mixes around −18 LUFS. A compressor, fixed gain and a limiter set below the target reached −14.5 LUFS with a −1.5 dBFS peak.
- Faces must never sit behind monitors or props; check every reacting face in the contact sheet.
